# FederatedLearning
Summer 2023 - Present: Code from Federated Learning Research. Includes code for neural networks, gradient descents, heterogenous shuffling, and federated learning on MNIST dataset.

Basic gradient descent (GD on MNIST) and neural network code that was created for this project is attached.

Multiclassification is One vs Rest. Federated code has not been added for research privacy.
Binary federated code is available. It shows the federated structure and can be tweaked to show comparisons with SGD.

For full explanation, check the research poster.
